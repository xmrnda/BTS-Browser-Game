The inspiration for my browser game was to combine two of my favorite things. My favorite pop group is BTS, and my favorite board game growing up was Connect 4. Therefore, I decided to create a BTS-themed Connect 4 in-browser game. 

Growing up, I played this game with my younger brother on a tangible game board. However, I wanted to create an online version of the game where we can play whenever and wherever we want, so long as we have a browser available. At the moment, the game is accessible solely via desktop and laptop computers, but I would like to make it compatible with smartphones and tablets in the future, as well. 

HOW TO PLAY:
1. Decide who will go first
2. Take turns dropping a chip into the grid by clicking on a column
3. The goal of the game is to CONNECT 4 of your chips in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent gets the chance to
4. Play defensively by blocking your opponents chips with your own
